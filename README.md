A multisig wallet to act as "safe" within your family 

You can use this to save or invest in opportunities as a group, since a certain number of people will be
required to approve the transaction for it to execute - essentially coming to consensus 

I plan to deploy this to the polygon L2 network to save on gas

In the future I may integrate this multisig wallet with DeFi applications, such as DEXs like uniswap, 
lending protocols such as Aave, and maybe even yield aggregators such as yearn.finance
